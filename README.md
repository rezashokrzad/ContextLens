# Word-Sense-Embedding-Visualization-Tool
This repository contains the code and documentation for a tool that provides a linguistic annotation of word embeddings. The tool is designed for scholars with linguistic rather than deep learning training, allowing them to investigate word use and meaning without the serious annotation time investment.

The main research question addressed in this study is ***whether we can provide tools for linguistic investigations on word use based on word embeddings***. To answer this question, we subdivide it into three subquestions, which are:
  - Can we visualize embeddings so that different "senses" are separated in the visualization, and similar senses are grouped?
  - Can we cluster embeddings to correspond to traditional "sense" groupings?
  - Can the tools be given a user interface that lets scholars use the tool without further intervention from data scientists?
  
We propose a visualization tool to depict different embedding algorithms color-grouped by diverse labeling systems. This tool can help to improve contextualized embedding and interpret embedding vectors for further linguistic research.

* We hope this tool will be helpful for data scientists and linguists who need a generic understandable language for communication. If you have any feedback or suggestions, please let us know by opening an issue in the repository.
