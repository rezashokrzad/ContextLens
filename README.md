# Word-Sense-Embedding-Visualization-Tool
This repository contains the code and documentation for a tool that provides a linguistic annotation of word embeddings. The tool is designed for scholars with linguistic rather than deep learning training, allowing them to investigate word use and meaning without the serious annotation time investment.
