# Word-Sense-Embedding-Visualization-Tool
This repository contains the code and documentation for the tool, ContextLens, an interactive tool that allows users to visualize, cluster,
and explore high-dimensional contextualized word embeddings. With ContextLens, linguistic investigations based on word embeddings no longer require explicit model training. Given either a single desired word to explore its senses or multiple distinct words, users can explore
possible patterns in the meanings of different words based on the context they appear. 

Through experimentation, combining dimensionality reduction and clustering methods led to a powerful way to understand the structure of word embeddings and identify different word senses. The toolâ€™s capabilities in visualizing embeddings, clustering, and providing user-friendly interfaces present significant opportunities for further research and applications in linguistics.

The main research question addressed in this study is ***whether we can provide tools for linguistic investigations on word use based on word embeddings***. To answer this question, we subdivide it into three subquestions, which are:
  - Can we visualize embeddings so that different "senses" are separated in the visualization, and similar senses are grouped?
  - Can we cluster embeddings to correspond to traditional "sense" groupings?
  - Can the tools be given a user interface that lets scholars use the tool without further intervention from data scientists?
  
We propose a visualization tool to depict different embedding algorithms color-grouped by diverse labeling systems. This tool can help to improve interpretation of contexualized embedding vectors for further linguistic research specially sense annotation.

* We hope this tool will be helpful for data scientists and linguists who need a generic understandable language for communication. If you have any feedback or suggestions, please let us know by opening an issue in the repository.
